      <h1>The Mental Development Behind a Human Being</h1>
      <p>
        In my opinion, what defines a human is whether they have values or ethics, otherwise, I see them as an empty shell. Although a newborn child has neither of these characteristics, how do they learn them? I believe that an individual learns these through various factors, such as their culture and the type of people they live with. Such factors soon develop their ethics and morals, making them human.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, a person’s morals and ethics can be influenced by the person’s culture. For example, during the Mi’kmaq creation story, Glooscap asked the animal, "Well, I want to ask if you can give up your life. Grandmother and I need to continue to live; we need to rely on your body, because you can provide for us. With your skin, we can make our clothing, with your flesh we can eat, with your bones we can make our tools, and your internal organs we can use for our medicines"(Augustine Line 109). The lesson of this part of the creation story was to teach the Mi’kmaq community to value the land around them by using every part of the animal, as well as to utilize everything and not be wasteful. Many other cultures play a role in the development of becoming human, one of which is Christmas. Christmas culture encourages children to be well-behaved for the reward of a gift from Santa Claus. The figure of Santa Claus encourages young children to learn about various values such as kindness, understanding, and being grateful. Although both cultures are different, they both influence the way people act, along with their morals and ethics.
      </p>
      <p>Secondly, the people children live around, whether it be family, friends, or a community they are in, play a key role in their development into becoming humans. For instance, in Moon of the Crusted Snow, when Maiingan asked Nicole whether the headlights in the distance were her father's, Nicole replied, "Maybe my son, wave anyway. Even if it's not him, the other guys would be happy to see you"(Rice 47). The setting proves that Maiigan lives around people who believe it is respectful to treat everyone with kindness, even if you do not know them. Everyone has at least one person who influenced their ethics or values, such as my sixth grade teacher. The teacher taught me invaluable lessons in developing my values and ethics. Prior to entering, I was a student who never paid attention in class and prioritized playing video games over studying and completing homework. Compared to past teachers, my sixth grade teacher reprimanded me more harshly than others, soon breaking my bad habits, developing a better work ethic, and teaching me to value my education more. Therefore, the environment someone lives in plays a key role in developing their morals and values, making them human rather than a wild animal.
      </p>
      <p>Although there are many factors, the culture and the community a child grows up in helps teach children different values and ethics, teaching them to be human. I think it is important for a child to grow up in a loving and caring environment and also experience devastating moments in life. The culture and community a person lives in help pass on what is considered the norm in their respective groups, allowing them to incorporate themselves into other communities.

      <h1>Unit 2 Rational</h1>
      <p>For the creative assignment, I decided to create a short comic on what I think it means to be a good community member. The comic is about an ant who was struggling to carry food back to the nest and was soon to be rescued. My comic has some similarities to the texts we have explored in class. For example, in The Dog, The Cat, And The Mouse by Basil Johnston, when the cats agreed to hold on to the peace treaty between the dog and humans, after holding onto the treaty for so long, "the cats got tired of holding this document. They asked the mice to care for the document because, among other qualities, the mice were fine archivists"(Johnston 1). The cat who gave away the document is similar to the red ant in the story. Both characters, who in the end left the character in need behind, demonstrates how not to be a good community member. The story quickly shifts to the blue ant stumbling up the exhausted green ant, who is unable to move. The blue ant then assisted the green ant with the transportation of the food and soon made it back to the nest. The blue ant in the story stayed with the green ant throughout the journey back to the nest, demonstrating how one should support people in need no matter how long it takes. Therefore, to be a good community member, one must be able to act as a pillar for the whole community when they are at their lowest. Another similar text was the video "5 Things To Know About Indigenous Humor" featuring Tim Fontaine by TVO Today Docs. During the fourth fact, it was stated that it could get dark. This is since they are "often faced with very sort of difficult situations. It's not that people are making light of it, maybe it is a coping mechanism."(Fontaine 1:55). The use of telling stories or even telling people about their struggles is often used as a coping mechanism even for me. This is also similar to how the blue ant stated in the comic that running out of energy mid trip happens to everyone, including themself. The act of telling people within their community about their struggles demonstrates to the other community members that the person is willing to be vulnerable in front of them, developing a stronger connection. As a result, being able to open up to those around you, as well as creating an environment in which others can open up and talk about their struggles, is critical. To conclude, I created a comic using the analogy of an ant colony. I made this decision because a single ant barely has enough strength to survive on its own. Although this is true, the ant species have evolved to live in colonies where their lives are built upon the cooperation and devotion of other ants, developing a harmonious relationship.</p>

        <h1>How do we learn to live together?</h1>
        <p >Although humanity has evolved drastically over many decades, the one issue we have not been able to solve is having a world where everyone can live together peacefully. I believe that people can live together if they follow a simple saying: treat people the way you want to be treated. In general, the way a person treats others gets returned to them in the same way by others. So whether someone is aggressive or kind, the other party will treat them in the same light. With this idea in mind, if people treat each other kindly, the act of treating others as you want to be treated could prevent many conflicts, which could prevent an even greater problem from arising. If everyone were to take such simple words to heart, the world would become a place where everyone could live together regardless of who they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Cottagers and Indians Documentary, when Drew Hayden Taylor asked for the cottager’s perspective, Larry, a fellow cottager, explains that the idea of "restoring of rice beds, in itself is a great idea, okay? Except Mr Whetung took it upon himself to expand that"(Taylor 33:15). Larry clearly demonstrates how he is not against the revival of rice crops but just has an issue with James' excessive planting to the point of inconveniencing others. From my view, Larry demonstrates the idea of  treating people the way you want to be treated very well since, although the wild rice disrupts his side of the lake, he is still willing to compromise and even agree with where James is coming from. When the settlers arrived in Canada, they treated the Indigenous people very poorly, throwing them onto reserves and having their children sent to residential schools. The idea that people are treated according to how they treat others was thrown back at the settlers with an example of James disrupting the cottagers.
        </p>
          <p>As well, it is clearly evident that James is aware of what he is doing as well. During the documentary, when Drew interviews James after the face-to-face confrontation with Larry, James talks about "how he's got a big group behind him. I gotta come here by myself. Well, I’ll get shot someday" (Taylor 41:42). James demonstrates that the situation at hand is so severe that he states that it wouldn't come as a surprise to him whether he got shot or not. The lesson of treating someone as you want to be treated is the simplest and easiest way for everyone to live together. I was able to experience this firsthand during elementary school. I remember how there was this one student who enjoyed putting others down and bullying. In the end, how he treated people led to his downfall. He was ostracized, and people began to band together to retaliate against him. Therefore, if everyone in society were able to treat each other with respect and kindness, the conflict within the world would cease to exist, creating a more peaceful world.</p>
          <p>To summarize, the act of treating others as you would like to be treated would have drastically altered the course of history. Many wars, crimes, and acts of oppression would never have happened if the prosecutors had just thought about how the victims felt and empathized with them.</p>

        <h1>Indigenous Literature, the Hidden Gem I Discovered</h1>
        <p>When one explores learning about a certain subject, it might seem tedious at first. There is always the urge to just give up, whether the subject is too hard or of no interest. Although one might lose heart, after they investigate the topic long enough, the benefits of learning soon make the urge to quit less distinguishable. Eventually, one will find something interesting, whether it be a lesson or something that correlates with their interest. Soon, one will see a whole new area of different ideas and possibilities. It is the same with Indigenous literature. During this course, the reading of Indigenous literature helps promote societal development by allowing students to see different perspectives and makes it easier to reconcile with the Indigenous communities. Therefore, in order for society to develop, we need to first deal with the inner conflict between people before we can start focusing on the development of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin, the reading of Indigenous literature allows the reader to see different perspectives. For example, in the Mi'kmaq worldview's creation story, Glooscap asked the animal,
          Well, I want to ask if you can give up your life. Grandmother and I need to continue to live; we need to rely on your body, because you can provide for us. With your skin, we can make our clothing, with your flesh we can eat, with your bones we can make our tools, and your internal organs we can use for our medicines”(Augustine).
          The Mi’kmaq live with the worldview of only taking what is needed. On the other hand, in western culture, people are more prone to taking more than is necessary, leading to a waste of resources. This is caused by the amount of income people make. As time goes on, more and more people move up into the higher classes, allowing them to be more flexible with the food they eat. As a result, people tend to buy extra food and necessities in case the food they buy is not enough. This idea results in a massive waste of food that could have been saved and given to people less fortunate. If society could adapt to only taking what is necessary, there would be a lower demand for food which will be beneficial. For example, it could reduce the amount of money needed to obtain food. And also, it could reduce the number of animals that need to be killed, decreasing the chance of overhunting. To summarize, the perspective of world views in Indigenous literature may serve as the final puzzle piece required to solve a major global problem. The act of being able to see different perspectives could lead the future leaders of the world to be more flexible and creative in their thinking, making it easier to decide on a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason why it is important is because it would make it easier to understand the Indigenous community, making it easier to reconcile about the past. For example, in Moon of The Crusted Snow by Waubgeshig Rice, the story takes place in the setting of an Indigenous community and gives the reader insight on the history and lifestyle of these communities. For example, when the schools in the communities shut down, Nicole was trying to teach Maiingan different Indigenous words by having him copy her. In return,
          [s]he took every opportunity to remind them of their Anishinaabemowin words. They had language classes at school, but there had been no regular classes for almost a month. The band couldn’t justify using fuel to keep the school open. Some teachers still held informal classes in their homes for families who wanted to maintain some kind of normal routine (Rice 128).
          Nicole demonstrates how even though the schools were closed, it was not going to stop her and other community members from educating their children. Nicole teaching her son even when the schools are closed reminds me of myself. For example, even if the schools are closed, this will not hinder my learning but rather provide me with the opportunity to review and get ahead in my other classes. While reading, it has become evident that they are not completely different from us. However, before reading, I thought there was going to be a drastic difference. This was caused by the influence of the media, which gave me a false idea of Indigenous culture when, in reality, they are no different than us. The method of allowing the reader to experience how an Indigenous community operates and see their point of view makes it easier to relate to their similarities and see their differences, which would otherwise be obscured by stereotypes and the media. Once we understand each other, it will be easier for the Indigenous community to reconcile with us. After achieving reconciliation, Canada can devote its full attention to other global issues. A country cannot expand its development until it deals with all its internal problems first. Therefore, the reading of Indigenous literature can build an understanding between the FNMI community and us, making it easier to reconcile. Once this is achieved, Canada can start focusing on developing as a country rather than being held back by internal problems.
        </p>
        <p>To conclude, the learning of Indigenous literature is useful since it allows the reader to get a different feel from the typical literature we read. Different perspectives, humor, ideas, and important pieces of their culture are hidden within these works of literature. Not only that, it could be the source of new ideas to solve problems in the world with a mix of western and Indigenous perspectives. The use of Indigenous literature also makes it easier for people of non-Indigenous backgrounds to understand, laying the foundation for reconciliation. Once this is achieved, Canada can start putting all its time into the development of the country to make what we believed to be a dream a reality. Although I was hesitant and uninterested when taking the course in the beginning, I was able to learn about the perspective of Indigenous people. Pieces of literature such as Moon of The Crusted Snow and Mi’kmaq world views have allowed me to better understand the FNMI community in many different ways. Things such as their lifestyle, opinions, culture, and world views have allowed me to see things through a different lens rather than through the lens of the western way of seeing things.
